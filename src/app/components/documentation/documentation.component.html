                Welcome to our interactive genome browser, a portal to the intricate world of gene expression dynamics
                in relation to age. Within this page you'll explore age's effect on gene expression across many genes,
                cell types, and tissues. Differential Expression Analysis was performed on a select portion of our
                database using linear regression, for more details see our publication at PUBLICATION URL HERE WHEN

                concise snapshot of the gene's age-dependent changes, providing you with swift insights into its dynamic
                behavior over time. Different patterns of gene expression are represented by colored bars:

                sections displays the UMAP and TSNE (when avaliable) of the overall study, the selected cluster can be

                groups, while those with high Gini indices are enriched in only a few. The red and blue vertical lines
                represent the Gini Index for the selected GO Term when enriched by upregulated (red) and downregulated

                On the right hand side of the page genes associated with the selected go term are ordered based on their
